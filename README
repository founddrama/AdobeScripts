# AdobeScripts
--------------

Some JavaScript-based utility scripts for Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop;
versions 10 and 7, respectively, which were the current versions back when I
wrote these scripts. I used these every day back in 2003; and now I'm putting
the source up here as a kind of archive or time capsule.
